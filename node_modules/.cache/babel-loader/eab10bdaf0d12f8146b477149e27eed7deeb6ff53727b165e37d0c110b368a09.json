Our study is divided into three parts. In the first phase, you are asked to fill out three sets of questionnaires that assess demographics, individual differences, and your music preferences as baselines. In the second phase, you will participate in a mental visualization task called Cyberball. This phase consists of watching an animation where you will use your imagination to engage in a ball-tossing game with two other computer-generated virtual players. It is important that keep your level of engagement in playing the virtual ball-tossing game to imagine the other two virtual players as people you know. Please immerse yourself in the game as realistically as possible. Following this game, you will briefly answer two sets of questionnaires. In the final phase of our study, you will log in to your Spotify account to play music of your choice. You can select a song in a generated playlist of ten randomly chosen tracks from your Liked Songs, or you can explore new music until the allocated time of 10 minutes is up.
